# Undergrad-research-paper
The code and presentation for my final undergraduate research paper on unconventional monetary policy.

I plan on rewriting the code in R soon to make it more accessible and efficient.

Found some interesting results and this project helped me form a real interest in both monetary policy as well as coding more generally.
